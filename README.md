My first website. It's a quiz about one of The Mama's and the Pappas most famous songs.

It was made with the bare basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript. A json file holds a pool of 10 questions. Each time the quiz is played 5 of those questions are pulled from the pool and presenented to the player. I've used Firebase to keep track of scores and the average of them across all times the game was played. At the end of the game the score for that particular play is compared to the average and presented to the player with a custom message.

Simple and fun (to play and even more to create).
